# price-momentum-trading-strategy
This Python project is inspired by “151 Trading Strategies” by Zura Kakushadze and Juan Andrés Serur. It implements the paper’s Simple Moving Average Stock strategy using Python, with pandas and NumPy supporting data processing, time-series handling, and numerical analysis. I also investigated the profitability of four different take-profit methods.
